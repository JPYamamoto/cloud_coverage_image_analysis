"""
Cloud Coverage Analysis.

Given an image whose path is received as the first argument when calling the
program, return the Cloud Coverage Index.

The Cloud Coverage Index is given by _CCI = N/C_ where _N_ stands for the
amount of pixels classified as cloud, and _C_ is the number of pixels in
the valid area of the given picture.

An optional flag "s" or "S" may be given, which indicates that the resulting
image after classifying every pixel should be saved to a file named:
`image-seg.jpg`
assuming that the given file was originally called `image.jpg`
